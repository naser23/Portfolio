          Hello! My name is Naser Abdulkadir and I'm an aspiring full stack web
          developer. I was looking for a career that would keep me engaged and
          would allow me to be creative and build new things as my skills
          improved and I could tell since my very first project that software
          development was the career I was looking for. Fast forward to today,
          and I have built many more projects and learned much more than I
          thought I could learn from when I started until now.
